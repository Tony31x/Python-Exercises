#For Loop

#Traverse the value in the range() function
#for i in range(100):
#    print(f"The value of i is {i}")


#The range function can accept 2 arguments. The first one is the starting value. The second is the end value (Won't be counted).
#for i in range(2, 8):
#    print(f"The value of i is {i}")

#It can also accepts 3 arguments
#for i in range(2, 8, 3): #Means start with 2, ends i 8,  and count by 3 (increment value).
#    print(f"The value of i is {i}")
